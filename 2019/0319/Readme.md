# Procedural Generation Hero Graphic
Write a hero graphic (width: 100%, height: 600px) that randomly generates characters which 'fly' across the screen. They should have the following characteristics:
* Font-awesome icons.  Use at least 4.
* Start on right side of screen and slowly float to left.
* Vary in size
* Vary in speed
* Vary in 'Z' axis
  * This should relate the size, as the bigger ones would be 'closer' to the screen.
