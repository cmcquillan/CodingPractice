# Arkanoid
A simple Arkanoid clone where there is a platform that can move back and forth on a single y-axis coordinate.  A ball that has consistent momentum, and a set of bricks that will be destroyed whenever the ball impacts with them.

## Things to Remember
* You will need to draw a circle on a canvas :)
* You will have consistent momentum like in snake but it will always be at an angle.

## Outcomes
* After 25 minutes ended up in a debugging loop with a strange browser behavior.  Sometimes this happens so I am going to do another 25 minute sprint after I have figured out the issue.
* It was a setTimeout and not a setInterval...
