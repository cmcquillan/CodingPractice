# Arkanoid
A simple Arkanoid clone where there is a platform that can move back and forth on a single y-axis coordinate.  A ball that has consistent momentum, and a set of bricks that will be destroyed whenever the ball impacts with them.

## Things to Remember
* You will need to draw a circle on a canvas :)
* You will have consistent momentum like in snake but it will always be at an angle.
