# Baby Activity Tracking
For the purposes of tracking baby-related activities (performed by parents).  These include but are not limited to:
* Feeding (frequency and duration)
* Changing (frequency and description)
* Sleeping (frequency and duration)

## Outcome 
A 'rapid prototype' of an app like this will need fewer components and fewer specific
classes overall.  The beginning of this process saw me creating several classes, multiple
components, and a couple routes.  This was antithetical to the nature of the exercise which
was to create a simple baby event tracking app in 25 minutes.  Creating anything remotely
functional in that fashion would likely take a couple hours.  It could potentially take
less time if I was more well-rehearsed in the 'new app' process or if I had a more clear speicifcation to work from initially.  I think trying again at a later date with boring object literals and a single app component would allow for the process to complete in a short period of time.
