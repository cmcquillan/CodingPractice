# Practice Coding

Sometimes I just fire up a text editor and do something.  This catalogs what I am writing as 'just for practice'.

## My Goals

My goal is to get better at rapid prototyping and generally learn new things by giving myself time pressure.  I will be setting tight time constraints on these prototypes (so the code will **not** be pretty, sorry).
